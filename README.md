Session and target files for conducting psychophysical experiments with the KineReach system. 
MATLAB code to generate target, trial session and target session files for conducting bimanual interference paradigm. For more info on the paradigm, visit here: 

To generate files, following information is needed:

**1. Subject ID** (as appropriate to your study)

**2. Experiment number** (0: Unimanual, 1: symmetric bimanual, 2: asymmetric bimanual, 3: cooperative bimanual (equal weighting))

**3. Number of conditions** (if Expt number is 0, then 4, else 2 for all others)

**4. Number of trials per condition** (as appropriate to your study; in current practice sessions, it is 5 for unimanual and 10 for bimanual. In this study, number of trials is 20)
